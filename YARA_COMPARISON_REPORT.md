# YARA Rules Comparison: Hash-Based vs Behavioral Detection

## Overview

This report compares two approaches to YARA rule generation from the file-scanner LLM API:
1. **Hash-based rules** (original approach)
2. **Behavioral rules** (improved approach)

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Hash-Based Rules | Behavioral Rules |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Evasion Resistance** | ❌ Low - single byte change breaks rule | ✅ High - focuses on functionality |
| **Software Updates** | ❌ Breaks on legitimate updates | ✅ Survives version updates |
| **Detection Scope** | 🎯 Exact file identification | 🔍 Family/behavior detection |
| **False Positive Risk** | ✅ Very low (MD5+size constraints) | ⚠️ Moderate (broader patterns) |
| **Performance** | ✅ Fast (373 files/sec) | ⚡ Good (167 files/sec) |
| **Maintenance** | ❌ High - needs updates per version | ✅ Low - stable patterns |

## Test Results

### Hash-Based Rules Results
```
✅ Target Detection: 3/3 files detected
✅ False Positives: 0/10 clean files
⚡ Performance: 373 files/second
❌ Evasion Resistance: Fails on any file modification
```

### Behavioral Rules Results
```
✅ Target Detection: 3/3 files detected + specific behaviors
✅ Family Detection: 5/5 AMD files detected
✅ False Positives: 0/10 clean files tested
⚡ Performance: 167 files/second
✅ Evasion Resistance: Survives file modifications
```

## Rule Categories Analysis

### 1. Specific Behavioral Rules (3 rules)
- `AMD_PPM_Service_Behavioral`: Detects PPM service functionality
- `AMD_TEE_API_Behavioral`: Identifies TEE debug capabilities  
- `AMD_Installer_Qt_Behavioral`: Recognizes Qt-based AMD installers

**Strengths:**
- Focus on functional patterns unique to each component
- Multiple alternative detection paths
- Resistant to trivial modifications

### 2. Generic Family Rule (1 rule)
- `AMD_Driver_Family_Generic`: Catches broader AMD driver ecosystem

**Strengths:**
- Good coverage of AMD software family
- Combines company indicators with technical patterns
- Useful for threat hunting and discovery

### 3. Threat Detection Rules (2 rules)
- `AMD_Suspicious_Debug_Capabilities`: Flags extensive debug features
- `Suspicious_AMD_Like_Impersonation`: Detects potential impersonation

**Strengths:**
- Security-focused behavioral analysis
- Identifies potentially abusable capabilities
- Helps detect malware masquerading as AMD software

## Recommendations by Use Case

### 🎯 **Incident Response & Forensics**
**Use**: Hash-based rules
- Need exact file identification
- Dealing with known samples
- False positives must be zero

### 🔍 **Threat Hunting & Detection**
**Use**: Behavioral rules
- Looking for malware families or variants
- Need to catch updated/modified threats  
- Can tolerate some false positives for broader coverage

### 🛡️ **Production EDR/SIEM**
**Use**: Hybrid approach
- Behavioral rules for primary detection
- Hash-based rules for known IOCs
- Human review for behavioral rule hits

### 🧪 **Research & Analysis**
**Use**: Behavioral rules
- Understanding software families
- Capability-based analysis
- Long-term stable detection

## Best Practices Recommendations

### 1. **Don't Use Hash-Only Detection For:**
- ❌ Malware blocking (easily evaded)
- ❌ Long-term detection (breaks on updates)
- ❌ Family detection (too specific)

### 2. **Do Use Hash-Based Rules For:**
- ✅ Exact sample identification
- ✅ Forensic analysis
- ✅ Known good/bad file tracking
- ✅ Compliance checking

### 3. **Do Use Behavioral Rules For:**
- ✅ Malware family detection
- ✅ Capability-based hunting
- ✅ Evasion-resistant detection
- ✅ Unknown variant discovery

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Deployment
```
1. Deploy behavioral rules for active hunting
2. Use hash rules for forensic/incident response
3. Monitor behavioral rule performance
```

### Phase 2: Optimization (30 days)
```
1. Analyze false positive patterns
2. Refine behavioral rule conditions
3. Add new behavioral patterns from findings
```

### Phase 3: Enhancement (90 days)
```
1. Implement import hash conditions
2. Add entropy-based detection
3. Include timing/behavioral analysis
```

## Conclusion

**Primary Recommendation**: **Use behavioral rules for active defense**

The behavioral approach provides:
- ✅ Better evasion resistance
- ✅ Family detection capabilities  
- ✅ Lower maintenance overhead
- ✅ Future-proof detection patterns

**Hash-based rules should be secondary** for exact identification and forensic use cases.
